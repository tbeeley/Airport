##Objectives

The test is to write software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. 
Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

The aim of the exercise was to practice OOP, SOLID principles and Ruby.
